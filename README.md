# Welcome

In this repo I just playing with angular 6 and material design as well

## Adding angular material (if you clone the repo this is not necesary my friend)
`npm i --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations`

`ng add @angular/material`

## If you want to change your current style ext to scss you can run:
`ng config schematics.@schematics/angular:component.styleext scss`
